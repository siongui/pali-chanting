Forward
+++++++

Except for two minor corrections, the Pāli of this edition follows the Pāli of
the Thai script edition published by Mahamakut Rajavidyalaya Press. The
corrections are in Nissaggiya Pācittiya 27, where *suvitañ-ca* and
*suvilekkhitañ-ca* have been changed to *suvītañ-ca* and *suvilekhitañ-ca*, in
line with the readings found in the Royal Thai edition of the Canon.

The English translation in this edition is based, with minor corrections, on the
translations of the Pāṭimokkha rules contained in the 2007 edition of
*The Buddhist Monastic Code*.

I would like to acknowledge the help I have received from many individuals in
preparing this edition in particular from Vens. Khematto Bhikkhu and Atthaññū
Bhikkhu here at Metta Forest Monastery, and from Vens. Jotipālo Bhikkhu and
Ahiṃsako Bhikkhu of Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery. Any mistakes that remain are
my own responsibility. If you find any, I would appreciate learning of them to
correct them in future editions.

   Yo vo Ānanda mayā dhammo ca vinayo ca desito paññato, so vo mam'accayena
   satthā.

   Ānanda, whatever Dhamma and Vinaya I have pointed out and formulated for you,
   that will be your Teacher when I am gone.

   Ime ca Subhadda bhikkhū sammā vihareyyuṃ, asuñño loko arahantehi assāti.

   And if these monks, Subhadda, live rightly, the world will not be empty of
   arahants.

   -Dīgha Nikāya 16
